### I've done a lot of Leetcode.

- I decided to setup a quick action to pull my Leetcode solutions and put them on my personal site
- https://tkruer.com/utils/solved

### Why do this?
- Really no reason. Maybe in a year I'll come back and realize the progress I have made?
- Everything syncs up automatically and I just pull it so why not
- I try to do 2 random questions a day. I have setup a CRON job automatically so I don't have to think about it.
